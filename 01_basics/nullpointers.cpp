// null value= a special value that means something has no value.
//              When a pointer is holding a null value,
//              that pointer is not pointing at anything (null pointer)

// nullptr=keyword represents a null pointer literal

// nullptrs are helpful when determining if an address
// was successful assigned to a pointer
// When using pointers,be careful that your code isn't
// dereferencing nullptr or pointing to free memory
//this will cause undefined behaviour
